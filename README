QUICKSTART

0. REQUIREMENTS

0.a.
    If you want local translations, you need to have Apertium installed on your server.
	Otherwise, remote translations will be done.

1. INSTALL

1.a. Upload the 'wp-apertium' directory to 'plugins' directory.
1.b. Log in WordPress and activate the plugin.


2. CONFIGURE

Edit inc/options.php to configure the plugin (language, target translations, content and title ID - see below).


3. EDIT TEMPLATE

To get translations placed in the right place, you have to wrap the post content and the post 
title in an html tag, with the following ID

	* Title: title-%s
	* Content: entry-%s

where %s is the post/page id number. (This can be overwritten on options.php). 

In order to get post/page id number you can use a core Wordpress function: the_ID();
As an example, you can write your title like:

	<a id="title-<?php the_ID(); ?>" href="<?php echo get_permalink() ?>" rel="bookmark" >
        <?php the_title(); ?>
    </a>

And the content as follows:

	<div id="entry-<?php the_ID(); ?>">
	<?php
		// the content itself!
		the_content(__('Read the rest of this entry') .' &raquo;');
	?>
	</div>

4. TRANSLATION FUNCTION

   There are three ways to get post translated.

   The first one, existing on versions previous to 0.9, writes translated text in
   the source code of the web page, and uses Javascript to show/hide each text.

   The second one uses AJAX to retrieve translations. It has the benefit that no
   duplicated html ID are found on source code. This will be the "official" method 
   used from now. Old method will still be supported on some versions.

   The third one (that can be merged with one of the previous) adds non-Javascript
   support to wp-apertium. You can get a translation using a URL variable:
        www.example.com -> your web page
        www.example.com/?lang=fr -> french version of your webpage

   The function must be invoqued just before the post is displayed, inside the
   loop.

4a. AJAX MODE

	<?php
		if (function_exists('apertium_translations')) { 
			apertium_tranlations($post->ID);
            $content = apertium_get_the_content();
            $title = apertium_get_the_title();
		} else {
            $content = get_the_content();
            $title = get_the_title();
        }
	?>

4b. OLD MODE

	<?php
		if (function_exists('apertium_old_translations')) {
			apertium_old_tranlations($post->ID);
            $content = apertium_get_the_content();
            $title = apertium_get_the_title();
		} else {
            $content = get_the_content();
            $title = get_the_title();
        }

	?>
